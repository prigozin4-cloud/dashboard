## ⚠️ AI Disclaimer

**Please note:** AI assistants can make mistakes, including:

- **Hallucinations**: Generating plausible-sounding but incorrect or fabricated information
- **Outdated information**: Knowledge cutoffs mean recent events or updates may not be reflected
- **Misunderstanding context**: Misinterpreting nuanced questions or ambiguous requests
- **Incomplete reasoning**: Missing edge cases or making logical errors in complex scenarios
- **Citation errors**: Providing incorrect sources or misattributing information
- **Code bugs**: Generated code may contain errors, security vulnerabilities, or inefficiencies
- **Inconsistency**: Contradicting previous statements within the same conversation

**Always verify critical information** from authoritative sources, especially for:
- Medical, legal, or financial advice
- Security-sensitive code or configurations
- Important decision-making
- Facts and statistics
